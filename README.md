</div>




**Cup** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to manage and interact with Cloud-Cup, a high-performance reverse proxy built for cloud-native microservices. This tool simplifies managing Cloud-Cup, making it easier to monitor, configure, and control your server without downtime.

Whether you're an operations engineer maintaining production environments or a developer running a local instance of Cloud-Cup, this CLI tool provides an intuitive way to manage your proxy servers and backend configurations.

### ðŸš€  While Cup is still in its early stages of development, hereâ€™s what you can do and what's planned:
- **Monitor Server Status**: Check whether Cloud-Cup is currently running or stopped.
- **Reload Configurations**: Update the Cloud-Cup configuration file on-the-fly without restarting the server.
- **View Backend Information**: Inspect individual backend servers or the entire cluster for debugging and monitoring.
- **Health Check**: Monitor the health and performance of Cloud-Cup and backend servers.
- **Automatic SSL/TLS Setup**: Configure and manage SSL certificates through the configuration file.
- **Hot Reloading**: Apply configuration changes without interrupting service.
- **Multitude of HTTP Versions Support**: Handle HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 protocols.

# ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

Right now, the Cup CLI tool is in its early stages with basic functionality for checking whether the Cloud-Cup server is running. More features will be rolled out in the coming weeks to enhance its capabilities for managing and controlling the Cloud-Cup proxy server.

Stay tuned for more updates and expanded functionality as development continues!
